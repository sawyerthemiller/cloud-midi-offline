## Overview
**Cloud MIDI Offline** is an offline version of [Cloud MIDI Player](https://midiplayer.ehubsoft.net/), designed to work entirely without an internet connection. Enjoy your MIDI files anywhere, anytime, with zero reliance on online services.  

## Features
- ✅ Fully offline MIDI playback  
- ✅ Responsive and intuitive UI  
- ✅ Lightweight and fast

## Warnings
- ❌ This must be hosted with a web server of sorts. Just opening the html files will not work
- ❌ If you get stuck on 'loading library' while offline, quit your browser and try again
- ❌ Absolutely no copyright infringement is intended. This project uses local copies of all files only available to the user at runtime and never requests anything else from the developer's server.
