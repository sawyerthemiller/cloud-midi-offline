## Overview
**Cloud MIDI Offline** is an offline version of [Cloud MIDI Player](https://midiplayer.ehubsoft.net/), designed to work entirely without an internet connection. Enjoy your MIDI files anywhere, anytime, with zero reliance on online services.  

## Features
- ✅ Fully offline MIDI playback  
- ✅ Responsive and intuitive UI  
- ✅ Lightweight and fast

## Warnings
This must be hosted with a web server of sorts. Just opening the html files will not work. I recommend HFS by rejetto.
